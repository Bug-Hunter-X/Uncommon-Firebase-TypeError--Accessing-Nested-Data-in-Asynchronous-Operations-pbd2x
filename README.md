# Uncommon Firebase TypeError: Handling Nested Data in Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur when working with Firebase's asynchronous data retrieval methods and nested data structures.

The issue arises when attempting to access deeply nested data within a document before verifying the existence of intermediate properties.  This can lead to a `TypeError` if the nested properties are not present.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a robust solution that avoids the error.

## Problem

Directly accessing deeply nested properties of an object returned from an asynchronous Firebase operation without sufficient checks can lead to errors if any of the intermediate properties are missing. This is particularly crucial with asynchronous data retrieval where the data structure might not be as expected.

## Solution

Implementing proper null checks before accessing nested properties is the key to resolving this issue.  The solution uses optional chaining and nullish coalescing operators to gracefully handle missing properties. This ensures that the code doesn't throw errors and provides a more robust and user-friendly experience.
